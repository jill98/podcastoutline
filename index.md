# Podcast Outline
**Topic:** I've always liked Youtube videos that analyzed films/television shows or common tropes and character types, so I thought I can try that out in a podcast format. So, because I just binged-watched *13 Reasons Why* on Netflix, I'm going to dissect the show and evaluate it as both a literary work and a statement on suicide.

## Introduction and Summation of the Story 
* **Time:** 2 minutes
* **Breakdown:** The podcast will start with some witty introduction before transitioning into a quick summation about the story and the production history behind it, as well as critical response and public reactions. I'll make sure to emphasize spoilers and how this interpretation is my opinion.
* **Sounds:** I'm in the process of making an intro theme on the GarageBand App, which will go between my introduction and the summary of the show.
## Why It Fails as a Suicide Story...Sort Of
* **Time:** 4-5 minutes
* **Breakdown:** I'll first establish the proficiency of the show as a work of fiction; pretty well-acted, well-written, and visually interesting, especially for a high school drama based on a book. Then I'll discuss how the show fails to deliver the suicide-awareness message the production team continuously promises. I'll address how the show portrays Hannah's suicide as a vindictive revenge plot rather than a outcome of mental illness and depression, and how the latter is never even a topic of discussion.
* **Sounds:** Just like the intro theme, I'm making a very simple background score that will play underneath the monologue on the GarageBand App, and this applies for all sections. There will also be a quick transition score for the transitioning of topics. I also want to use audio from the show, but I'm struggling with getting access to it.
## The Dissection of Hannah Baker
* **Time:** 3-4 minutes
* **Breakdown:** I'll do an analysis of the portrayal of Hannah Baker, and weigh it's inconsistencies as the character flip-flops from the Deadpan Snarker Cool Girl trope to unconfident and introverted the next. I'll address her witty tone on her tapes, and her lack of empathy and ability to communicate with others, and, again, how mental illness was never addressed.
* **Sounds:** The simple background track and transition score from GarageBand and some audio from the show as evidence. 
## Conflicts: Progressive and Conservative Cherry-Picking.
* **Time:** 3-4 minutes
* **Breakdown:** I'll talk about some of the more progressive changes the show made from the book in order to match our current social climate, particularily those of diversity of color and sexuality of characters. Then I'll address how some changes cause problems in the overall narrative, and how, despite the show's insistence that they are a progressive take on suicide, they tend to show the descent into suicide in a conservative, or at least old-fashioned, way.  
* **Sounds:** Same as before.
## The Perpetually Toxic Relationship Between Fiction and Reality
* **Time:** 3-4 minutes
* **Breakdown:** 
* **Sounds:** Same as before
## Season Two Confusion and Conclusion
* **Time:** 2 minutes
* **Breakdown:** I'll quickly sum up my thoughts and share some predictions and doubts I have about the announcement on a second season. I'll give a quick goodbye and stuff like that.
